# Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow and PostgreSQL

*Apache Airflow | Python | SQL | PostgreSQL | Docker*

This is a personal project I've been working on. The aim was to build a simple data pipeline, extracting data from diffetent sources (API, CSV file and a Database server), loading to a database (PostgreSQL), using Apache Airflow as a data orchestration workflow tool.
